# Design Patterns - Lateral Hire Onboarding Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the key design patterns used in the Lateral Hire Onboarding Application. The current implementation focuses on simplicity and maintainability while providing a foundation for future scalability.

## 2. Current Implementation Patterns

### 2.1 Monolithic Architecture (Current)

**Pattern Description:**
The application is currently implemented as a monolithic .NET 7 Web API with a clear separation of concerns through layered architecture.

**Implementation:**
- Single .NET 7 Web API project
- Angular 16 frontend as a separate application
- In-memory repositories for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Controller layer for API endpoints

**Benefits:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, test, and deploy
- **Development Speed**: Faster initial development
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug and troubleshoot
- **Consistency**: Single technology stack

**Usage in Application:**
- UserService handles user management
- JourneyService manages learning journeys
- ContentService manages learning content
- TaskService handles task management
- ChatBotService provides AI assistant features

### 2.2 RESTful API Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
The application exposes functionality through RESTful APIs following HTTP conventions.

**Implementation:**
- Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON for data exchange
- Proper HTTP status codes

**Benefits:**
- **Standardization**: Follows REST conventions
- **Interoperability**: Easy integration with frontend and external systems
- **Caching**: HTTP caching can be leveraged
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent

**Usage in Application:**
- /api/users for user management
- /api/journeys for learning journey operations
- /api/contents for content management
- /api/tasks for task operations
- /api/chatbot for AI assistant interactions

## 3. Core Design Patterns

### 3.1 Repository Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
The Repository pattern abstracts the data access layer, providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

**Implementation:**
- Repository interfaces define data access methods (IUserRepository, IJourneyRepository, etc.)
- In-memory implementations for current development
- Entity Framework ready for future database integration
- Generic repository base class for common operations

**Benefits:**
- **Abstraction**: Data access details are hidden from business logic
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested with mock repositories
- **Maintainability**: Data access code is centralized
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch from in-memory to database implementation

**Usage in Application:**
- IUserRepository for user data access
- IJourneyRepository for journey data access
- IContentRepository for content data access
- ITaskRepository for task data access
- IChatBotRepository for chatbot data access

### 3.2 Service Layer Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
The Service Layer pattern encapsulates business logic and provides a simplified interface for the application layer.

**Implementation:**
- Service interfaces define business operations
- Service implementations contain business logic
- Services coordinate between repositories and external systems
- Dependency injection for service registration

**Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from controllers
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple controllers
- **Testability**: Business logic can be unit tested
- **Maintainability**: Business rules are centralized

**Usage in Application:**
- UserService for user management operations
- JourneyService for learning journey operations
- ContentService for content management
- TaskService for task operations
- ChatBotService for AI assistant functionality

### 3.3 Dependency Injection Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
Dependency Injection provides dependencies to an object rather than having the object create them itself.

**Implementation:**
- Built-in .NET Core dependency injection container
- Service registration in Program.cs
- Constructor injection for dependencies
- Interface-based dependency registration

**Benefits:**
- **Loose Coupling**: Classes depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked for testing
- **Maintainability**: Dependencies are managed centrally
- **Flexibility**: Implementations can be swapped easily

**Usage in Application:**
- Repository injection into services
- Service injection into controllers
- Configuration injection for settings
- HttpClient injection for external API calls

### 3.4 Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
MVC separates application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

**Implementation:**
- Models represent data and business logic (User, Journey, Content, etc.)
- Controllers handle HTTP requests and coordinate with services
- Views are handled by the Angular frontend
- DTOs for data transfer between layers

**Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, logic, and presentation
- **Maintainability**: Each component can be modified independently
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Models and controllers can be reused

**Usage in Application:**
- UserController handles user-related HTTP requests
- JourneyController manages learning journey operations
- ContentController handles content management
- TaskController manages task operations
- ChatBotController provides AI assistant endpoints

### 3.5 Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
DTOs are objects that carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls.

**Implementation:**
- Separate DTO classes for API requests and responses
- Mapping between domain models and DTOs
- Validation attributes on DTOs
- Consistent naming conventions

**Benefits:**
- **Decoupling**: API contracts are separated from domain models
- **Validation**: Input validation is centralized
- **Versioning**: API versions can be managed independently
- **Security**: Internal model structure is hidden

**Usage in Application:**
- UserDto for user data transfer
- JourneyDto for journey information
- ContentDto for content data
- TaskDto for task information
- ChatBotMessageDto for chatbot interactions

## 4. Frontend Patterns (Angular)

### 4.1 Component-Based Architecture

**Pattern Description:**
Angular's component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability through modular components.

**Implementation:**
- Standalone components for Angular 16
- Component hierarchy with parent-child relationships
- Input/Output properties for component communication
- Services for shared functionality

**Benefits:**
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Modularity**: Application is broken into manageable pieces

**Usage in Application:**
- UserDashboardComponent for user overview
- JourneyListComponent for displaying learning journeys
- TaskCardComponent for individual tasks
- ChatBotComponent for AI assistant interface

### 4.2 Service Pattern

**Pattern Description:**
Angular services provide shared functionality and data access across components.

**Implementation:**
- Injectable services with dependency injection
- HTTP client services for API communication
- State management through services
- Singleton services for shared data

**Benefits:**
- **Code Reuse**: Services can be used by multiple components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from UI logic
- **Testability**: Services can be mocked for testing
- **Maintainability**: Centralized business logic

**Usage in Application:**
- UserService for user-related operations
- JourneyService for learning journey management
- ChatBotService for AI assistant communication
- HttpService for API interactions
